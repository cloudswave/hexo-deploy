# DEPRECATED
I no longer use Hexo nor this action.  
Please use hexo's suggested/recommended way to deploy to github pages.  
https://hexo.io/docs/github-pages.html  

Remove this action from your repo `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`  
Add a new action `.github/workflows/pages.yml` and put the following content on the new file.  
```
name: Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master # default branch

jobs:
  pages:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Use Node.js 12.x
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: '12.x'
      - name: Cache NPM dependencies
        uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: node_modules
          key: ${{ runner.OS }}-npm-cache
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.OS }}-npm-cache
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
      - name: Deploy
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.HEXO_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./public
```
  
# Hexo Deploy Action


This [GitHub action](https://github.com/features/actions) will handle the building and deploying process of hexo project.

## Getting Started

You can view an example of this below.

```yml
name: Build and Deploy
on: [push]
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@master
      with:
        submodules: true

    - name: Build and Deploy
      uses: solybum/hexo-deploy@master
      env:
        HEXO_GEN: false # Don't npm install and hexo generate if HEXO_GEN is false
        PERSONAL_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        PUBLISH_REPOSITORY: solybum/solybum.github.io # The repository the action should deploy to.
        BRANCH: master  # The branch the action should deploy to.
        PUBLISH_DIR: ./public # The folder the action should deploy.
```

if you want to make the workflow only triggers on push events to specific branches, you can like this: 

```yml
on:
  push:	
    branches:	
      - master
```

## Configuration

The `env` portion of the workflow **must** be configured before the action will work. You can add these in the `env` section found in the examples above. Any `secrets` must be referenced using the bracket syntax and stored in the GitHub repositories `Settings/Secrets` menu. You can learn more about setting environment variables with GitHub actions [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsenv).

Below you'll find a description of what each option does.

| Key  | Value Information | Type | Required |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `PERSONAL_TOKEN`  | Depending on the repository permissions you may need to provide the action with a GitHub Personal Access Token in order to deploy. You can [learn more about how to generate one here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line). **This should be stored as a secret**. | `secrets` | **Yes** |
| `PUBLISH_REPOSITORY`  | The repository the action should deploy to. for example `solybum/solybum.github.io` | `env` | **Yes** |
| `BRANCH`  | The branch the action should deploy to. for example `master` | `env` | **Yes** |
| `PUBLISH_DIR`  | The folder the action should deploy. for example `./public`| `env` | **Yes** |
| `HEXO_GEN`  | Don't npm install and hexo generate if HEXO_GEN is false, default generate | `env` | **No** |
